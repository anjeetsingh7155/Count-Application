# Count-Application
This is to learn the React.js and Redux.js framework .
Built a simple yet powerful Counter App to understand core Redux concepts like:

âœ… Actions
âœ… Reducers
âœ… Slices
âœ… Store
âœ… State management

Used useSelector and useDispatch hooks to handle real-time UI updates on button clicks (Increment / Decrement). It was a great hands-on experience applying Redux to manage application state effectively.
